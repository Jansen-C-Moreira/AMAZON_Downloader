Bot to get all the books the amazon is giving for free
Hello everyone, my name is Jansen, im brazilan.
After see that Amazon is giving for free more than 50k of books i decided to make a bot to get all of them, so i did that and that is the code that you can use for this purpose.
Fisrt#
To use this bot you need to put your Amazom's username and password, after that select a languagem, or a custom URL that you can get for yourself and put in the correct field
Seconde#
If you login in Amazon with two steps login( Using a code from your e-mail or phone) wait the bot go to this place, and after that, you have 30s to type de code and click in continue
Three#
The bot will keep trying getting the books eventhough that it haven`t more books, beacuse it doesn't know that, so you have to pay attention if the bot is not keeping in the same page, or getting the same books as well.

I hope you like the code, see you by =)
