# AMAZON_Downloader
(MADE A LONG TIME AGO)
//obs.: This project is out to date. It was developed almost three years ago. I improved a lot as a python developer.Therefore, this code it's for personal comparison.
Bot designed to obtain all the books the amazon is giving for free.


Hello everyone, my name is Jansen, im brazilan.
After seeing that Amazon is giving for free more than 50k of books I decided to make a bot that will take all of them, so I did that and that is the code, you can use it for this purpose.
Fisrt#
To use this bot you need to put your Amazom's username and password, after that, select a languagem, or a custom URL that you can get for yourself and put in the correct field
Second#
The bot will keep trying getting the books eventhough theres no more to get, because it doesn't know that, so you have to pay attention.

I hope you like the code, see you, bye =)
